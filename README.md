#Introduction

This module allows GM's of the PF2E system to quickly create NPC's.  It will add a button called 'NPC Generator' to your actors page.  

Clicking the button will open a dialog and allow you to randomize NPCs of all types

Features

- You can edit any of the fields and dropdowns, and lock them in place with the 'fix' checkbox.  If a field is 'fixed', it won't change when the randomize button is clicked.

-- Clicking 'Create NPC' will place that NPC in the root of your actors folder.  You can then edit the NPC to taste.

-- The tokens for this module are located in the modules\npc-generator\tokens directory.  The application randomly picks a token based on the chosen ancestry. You can add tokens to this directory to your heart's content.  Take a look at the filenames of the tokens for naming conventions.

At the moment, the commoner class selection only has human commoner tokens.  I will change this in future iterations.

-- The module applies ability boosts to your NPC based on the ability boost information in your chosen Ancestry, Class, and Background.  If the application is presented with a choice (ie: between DEX and STR for example), it will randomly choose between them.

-- The module also creates a random background for your NPC in the Backstory section of the Biography.  This is to help spark DM imagination in a pinch.  Use or ignore whatever elements you wish.
